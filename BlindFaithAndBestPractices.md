## Blind Faith And Best Practices

### Abstract: 
Stop using ==, you must use Sass, all your coding problems can be solved with Node.JS. So much advice and best practices, some of it from well-respected leaders in our web-dev community and much of it extremely dogmatic. 

So how do you filter out the noise and find a happy middle ground? How do you go about finding the best practices you should follow in a practical world where things are messy? 

This talk goes over some of the common front-end best practices and encourages engineers to not just blindly follow best practices, but understand the WHY behind them.
